## Project Summary

In short, SAINT needs a new website built on WordPress. Their old one is out-of-date because it was built a decade ago and doesn’t really support the team to update it. Ideally, they'd like a pretty simple “brochure-ware” website with the ability for them to make modest changes, built on WordPress.

Current site: http://www.saintvolunteertransportation.org/

## What is SAINT?

Senior Alternatives in Transportation (SAINT) is a local non-profit agency providing personal transportation to people sixty years old and older, and people with disabilities that prevent them from driving. They provide literally thousands of rides per year in the Northern Colorado area given by hundreds of volunteers, managed by a small team in their Fort Collins office.

## Relevant Project Ideas and Thoughts

* SAINT is already paying for hosting their website at Dreamhost. Dreamhost is quite capable of hosting WordPress websites, so a new hosting solution is probably not necessary.
* While their current website has served them well, it’s not very easy to use. Nor is it especially pretty. So probably nothing to save.
* Basically the process should be: deploy a WordPress install to their Dreamhost in a directory/subdomain, work with them to select a theme and fill it with content, push that WordPress site to the root of their domain. Done! (Obviously that’ll take a few meetings, about a dozen emails, and maybe a little more. But that’s the likely project process.)
* The only functionality they would like the website to have right now is a “contact form” that emails them. Everything else is just “informational pages." An “events calendar” is a nice-to-have.
* They’re willing to pay for some (commercial) WordPress plugins or themes if that makes sense. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel here for the sake of having some code artifacts CFFC can say we did.
* The SAINT team would benefit from some WordPress training, but it’s not completely necessary for the same person who builds the site to do that. Please speak up if you’re interested in one or the other.
