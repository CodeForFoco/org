For the purposes of encouraging collaboration and allowing maximum visibility into what it going within the group, when starting a new Code for Fort Collins project, the following steps should be followed:

1. Assign project leads (ideally you will have at least two)
1. Create a Slack channel with the name of the project
3. Create a GitHub repository for the project
4. In that GitHub repository for that project, add the following
    1. a description of the project
    1. the leads and all people who are currently working on it
    1. a summary of how members can contribute
4. Drop a link to the GitHub repository on the Slack channel you created in the second step
5. (optional) Add a blog post announcing the project on the website
