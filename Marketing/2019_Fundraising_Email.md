# Kickoff: Code for Fort Collins, Fundraising Week, Party on Saturday

This week we're starting a brand new tradition at Code for Fort Collins: our annual fundraising drive to cover incidental costs: food, technology needs, and paying rent for meeting space. Remember, we're a completely volunteer organization, and that donations to us (through Code for America, more on that tomorrow) are completely tax deductible. There's a real 501(c)3 here ðŸ¤“

What to expect this week? We'll be emailing (week)daily to highlight who we are, what we've done, and how you can help. 

And if you're not busy, we'd love to meet you in person. We'll plan to be at ______________ from __ pm to __ pm on Saturday and would love to chat with you about Code for Fort Collins.

# What is Code for Fort Collins?

Code for Fort Collins (CFFC) is a technology meetup group. But we're more than that: we're a volunteer team that's trying to improve Fort Collins and serve the citizens of northern Colorado. We do that through using our technology, design, and other skills, but also our time and energy.

Code for Fort Collins is supported in this mission by Code for America. Code for America is a non-profit that builds technology tools for government (Clear My Record, CalFresh) and organizes a brigade program. CFFC is a Code for America brigade. 

Code for America serve as CFFC's "fiduciary," which is a fancy way to say they manage our money. They handle our donations, reimburse us for expenses, and also make sure that we're using the money on reasonable things (technology, food for meetings, etc) and not, say, a ski pass for a single member.

Members of Code for Fort Collins return becuase they care about the community. They make friends, learn things, and generally do it for love. But they'd love CFFC a little more with a nice dinner during meetings. And if they could have a little less logistical complexity figuring out how to budget for simple thing like web hosting for projects. That's what this fundraising drive is about.

See you tomorrow,
David

# The Great Work We've Done

Today we want to explain some of the work that the Code for Fort Collins brigade has done in the last year that you may not know about. We think there's some really cool stuff here, and we've spent a lot of time on it.

First, we've got a project we're (finally) just about done with, Solar Scorecard. Solar Scorecard uses the Fort Collins OpenData portal to find out about solar installations in the city, then map them are chart how we're doing relative to Boulder, and the city's energy plans.

Next, the Homeward 2020 Data Dashboard. While this project continues to evolve having "graduated" from Code for Fort Collins, it was we who were able to help the inter-agency task force first bring the data to the public. Here's what Holly had to say about that:

Finally, we want to highlight a project we're still working on. In collaboration with the Poudre Fire Authority, we're making it easy for fire fighters (who are the front lines to many citizen's interactions with quasi-government figures) to better connect people with free resources in the city. Things like heating assistance, wheel chairs, mental health aid and more are offered freely to many of our citizen. By better connecting these first-responders to that knowledge, we're hopeful that non-emergency situations can lead to a better connected city (well, technically, fire district).

See you tomorrow,
David

# How You Can Help

Hopefully by now we've convinced you that Code for Fort Collins is a good organization doing good things in the city. If that's the case, we hope you're also thinking "how can I help further this worthy work?"

There are many ways. The biggest reason we're writing today is the most concrete: you can donate funds to our cause. It's pretty simple, you'll just click the link, and Code for America will make sure we spend your tax-deductible donation responsibly. Here's the link:

If money's not what you've got to give, we'd also love your help in other ways. Primarily, you can either join our team or share knowledge of our work with interested people. We're always both looking for new projects and new volunteers. If you'd like to know more about either, check out...
