# 2016 Strategic Plan

**ATTENTION:** Right now this document is just a bunch of stuff copy pasted from CFA. It has a lot of valuable things to consider while creating an action plan but IS not our action plan.

## Intro

A strategic plan will help your Brigade identify what you want to do in 2016. Use this as an opportunity to collectively decide what your Brigade will focus on and how you will get there.

### Checklist

- Invite your core team (and government and community partners, if appropriate) to a planning meeting
- Think about what you want to accomplish in the next year (small wins are ok!)
- Document your vision
- Articulate your tactics (the more specific the better!)
- Submit your strategic plan to Code for America
- Schedule time to revisit your strategic plan throughout the year

### Key Questions

- What does our Brigade want to accomplish this year?
- What partners would we like to work with in 2016?
- What strategies and tactics will our Brigade use to meet our goals?
- What outcomes do we envision for the end of 2016? Why is it worth it for our core team and the Brigade volunteers to do this work?

## The Plan

This document is a starting point creating a strategic plan for 2016, based on [CFA's Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EB0Vv0yIkFQM_xpOaUS13loogYy0qtcnVxdo32mlCRA/edit#)

### Executive Summary

The goal of developing this plan is to help your group determine the answers to the following questions:

- Why is becoming/continuing your work as a Brigade important to your community and why is your group ready to do this?
- What will be the focus of your work in 2016?
- How will your work as a Brigade drive impact in your local community, as well as for your partners and your members?

### Team Development

Describe the organization and team:

- What is your current organizational structure?
  - Who is on your core team?-
  - What skills and backgrounds are missing from your core team?
- How will your core team share responsibility?
  - How often will your core team meet?
  - How many hours a week does everyone have to volunteer?
  - How will you make decisions?
  - No need to write this down but good to discuss and set expectations.

### Partners and Members

Describe your partners and members.

- Who do you want to partner with in 2016?
  - List both government and community partners.
- What does your membership look like now and how do you want it to grow in 2016?


If you don’t have a baseline of your Brigade membership demographics, it is a good idea to run an annual survey to collect this data. [Here are the questions we ask](https://cfa.typeform.com/to/BEKp9Y).

We also have an [attendance tool](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/attendance) we can get your Brigade set up with to help you track membership activity throughout the year. Email [andrewh@codeforamerica.org](mailto:andrewh@codeforamerica.org) to get access.

### Programmatic Focus, Alignment, and Impact

Describe the work your Brigade will do and the impact it will have in your community.

- What will your Brigade’s activities and projects be?
- What resources will you need to do this work?
- What will the impact of the work be?

Most Brigades will focus their efforts on organizing hack nights and events like CodeAcross and National Day of Civic Hacking.

Brigade projects will often be added as they develop throughout the year and require resources outside of space at hack night or events. More experienced Brigades may have projects that they want to continue developing from the previous years.

Use [this prospective projects and events template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zHjB1FTy5Qz950MD2Dk1U_hY1LoF8T81TUDVKEEkV0/edit#gid=1068986135) to answer these questions.



### Financial Model & Fund Development

Use [these tools](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ANUIfVr0M3kAFr5F6M-EnJt8dK4fMNRzBELlCfIiyUg/edit#gid=0) to identify how much your Brigade will need to fundraise in 2016.

- What are your projected  costs for 2016?
  - Use this budget template to document your costs.

You’ve likely identified most of your events and project costs in your [projects and events spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zHjB1FTy5Qz950MD2Dk1U_hY1LoF8T81TUDVKEEkV0/edit#gid=1068986135). Transfer those to your budget spreadsheet.

Now think through any fixed costs you’ll have throughout the year. These might include venue rental for hack night, hardware, etc.

- Are there any other fundraising strategies you’ll use that are not tied to projects or events?
  - Crowdfunding? If so, how will you execute?
  - Individual giving campaign? If so, how will you execute?
  - Organizational sponsorship? If so, what / how?
