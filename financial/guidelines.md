##Within the mission of the entire org is the implementation and maintenance of sound financial practices.

###Maybe something like this? -

## We always -

- Spend less than we have
- Consider the ROI (Return On Investment)
- Account for long term cost (Such as TCO or Total Cost of Ownership)
- Get receipts for everything

## We never -

- Make a purchase without doing research (includes pizza ;-) )
- Doubt the expense when we've determined it's the right thing to do
- Lie, Cheat, Steal or Manipulate to get money in or take money out
- Rob Peter to pay Paul (redirect previously designated funds)
