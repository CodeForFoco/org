## Why

This document exists to share with people who might be interested in getting CFFC (Code for Fort Collins) involved in helping them make something. We can send this to help them understand whether or not they might be a fit.

## What is an ideal CFFC project?

Code for Fort Collins is a small volunteer organization. As such, our best projects have a few core things: a relaxed timeline, some clear reason that a volunteer wants to work on them, and a single or small group of stakeholders who will help us solve problems and market the project.

Things that make them even better: evidence they will be successful and impactful if used (and thus a clear set of eager users), a vision about why people will use the project, and some funds available to cover costs for us.

## What if I'm not sure? Or want help anyway?
