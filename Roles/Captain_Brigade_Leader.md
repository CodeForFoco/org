A Captain is the term we've chosen for "brigade leader". A Captain has the responsibility to...

* Maintain and grow brigade capacity but being the public face of the organization at tech events, community events, fundraisers and within brigade meetings.
* Lead brigade meeting and proactively solve issues arising across the brigade. This means promoting new leaders, identifying emerging needs, and keeping everyone involved with the brigade happy. 
* Attend and improve quarterly brigade leadership meetings in which all current captains evaluate progress, make new action items, and check in on progress of initiatives.
* Maintain and improve relationships with Code for America. This means attending at least one national meeting a year, being known and listed in CFA events, and being a supportive member of the wider Code for America brigade ecosystem.
* Actively attend meetings, communicate in Slack, and generally be reasonably available and responsive to communications. While there aren't hard requirements, a Captain should attend meetings as much as they can, ideally no less than once per month. When not in attendance, they should continue to support and communicate with brigade members and fellow leaders. 

## Leadership Phasing and Succession

A Captain serves in this capacity for a two consecutive years, being available after not holding that term for re-election in the event that they want to. The first year of captainship, one maintains it in a support role, being effectively the "Supporting Captain". The following year, when the "Lead Captain" role retires, the previous year's "Support Captain" becomes the new "Lead Captain" with a new member stepping into the "Support Captain" role.
