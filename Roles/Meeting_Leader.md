Meeting Leaders manage and support meetings held by the Brigade twice a month a Cohere. Responsibilities include:

* Being trained and approveD by the Cobere team to let people into meetings.
* Arriving at least five minutes early to Cohere for meetings for which you are the primary lead. Letting people in from at least five munutes before to five minutes after the scheduled meeting start time. 
* While Brigade Captains are responsible for maintaining the meeting lead board, individual meeting leaders should be generally available to lead in case of emergency.
* Within the space of the meeting, it is the Meeting Lead's job to run the meeting. This means presenting CFFC to new members on relevant nights, facilitating problem solving for issues that arise in the standup, and communicating broader issues To Brigade Captains.

The Meeting Leader role should be held by five (5) members at a time. While it doesn't *need* to be a direct relationship, being a Meeting Leader is a great stepping stone to be becoming a Brigade Captain. But we also need people who can and will simply maintain the Meeting Leader position for years.
