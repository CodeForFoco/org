A Community Liaison is an external face of Code for Fort Collins. As such, they advocate for Code for Fort Collins, promote the group in the community, and connect with people in the Fort Collins (and Northern Colorado) community who either have access, project ideas, or money to help CFFC better execute its mission.

## Responsibilities of Community Liaisons include...

* **Meet regularly with community members (non-CFFC-members) to discuss Code for Fort Collins.** Whether these people work in the city, a non-profit, or at a company, making more people aware of and interested in the success of CFFC is the explicit goal and purpose of these meetings. If they're productive either financially or project-wise for the group, all the better. We don't have a set meeting frequency, be once a month should be thought of as the approximate minimum for someone holding this role.
* **Seek to present Code for Fort Collins in a positive light in more-formal presentations.** These are more-formal and larger-audience marketing efforts, and would happen much less frequently.
* **Attend Quarterly Leadership Meetings** to discuss ways that the brigade can connect better with community and better accomplish its mission.
* **Attend some regular meetings to keep up with the Brigade and be a known face to Brigade members.** "Some regular meetings" is intentionally vague. No less than one meeting a quarter is recommended, monthly would be even better.
* **Shepard new projects into the group.** This role is neither a Project Leader nor necessarily technical, but the Community Liaison should be comfortable finding collaborators inside the group, bringing them into the process with the external stakeholders, and setting that new partnership up for success.
* **Help plan overall external marketing plan.** Community Liasons are neither the entire public relations team, but they're an important part of it. They should contribute to the efforts, and should be willing able to collaborate with Marketing Team Members.

## Liaison Phasing and Succession

A Liaison serves in this capacity for **two consecutive years**. The first year of Liaison-ship, you serve in a "junior" role, being effectively the "Supporting Liaison". The following year, when the "Lead Liaison" role retires, the previous year's "Support Liaison" becomes the new "Lead Captain" with a new member stepping into the "Support Captain" role. In the intervening year, the "Lead Liaison" will connect the "Support Liaison" with all of their existing relevant connections.
