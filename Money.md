Preamble: Code for Fort Collins (CFFC) has signed an memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Code for America. 
(You can find it at: https://codeforfoco.slack.com/files/U22RAQ28Y/FB843HF0V/code_for_fort_collins_relationship_letter.pdf) 
That MOU specifies (among other things) that Code for America will act as a fiduciary for CFFC.
That means that we don't exist as an independent legal entity, and use them for money matters.
Practically that means we raise to them, and then spend seperately, getting reimbursed by then. 

Here's my rough understanding of the procedures now (David in Sept 2018). 
But treat CFA answers and/or documentation as more truthful than this if it's ever an issue

# How We Raise Money

As a brigade, we can have money donated to CFA as a brigade for our use. Our current form is set up to do it.

# How We Spend Money

After money has been raised (an important precondition), we spend it via our own accounts. 
That means spend on your own credit card/debit card/etc.
Then you submit that to CFA for reimbursement.
Assuming it's reasonable, they say they reimbursement promptly. (I've never done it.)

There are reasonably limits on what we can spend on as a bridgade. 
Once we have money, if you have any questions, just reach out to a Captain (David or Dan, right now) about spending money on anything.
