## <a name="intro"></a> Introduction

Everyone is welcome to come and contribute to our projects and improve Code for Fort Collins.

We use a fork / pull request workflow, a brief description can be found in our [TL;DR](#tldr); whereas, a more in depth guide is outlined in the [Contributing Guide](#contribute).

If for some reason you still feel lost, there are some resources related to the workflow that may help in the [Git & Github Resources](#resources) section.

## <a name="tldr"></a> TL;DR Contributing Guide

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and clone your fork.
1. Make a patch branch.
1. Make changes, commit and push.
1. Submit a pull request and your changes will be reviewed and merged.

## <a name="contribute"></a> Contributing Guide

First, `fork` the repository,

Next, `clone` your `fork`:

```bash
git clone <your fork url>
```

Navigate into the directory using `cd`.

Now we want to add the original repository we forked from as a remote upstream, this way we can sync back up with it later without deleting the fork:

```bash
git remote add upstream <original repository URL>
```

To confirm, let's list our remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Then, `checkout` a new `branch` from `master`:

```bash
git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
```

Make some changes! Any time you make a change be sure to `commit` with a detailed message:

```bash
git commit -am "commit message here"
```

- the `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.
- the `-m` command line option will specify that your commit message follows in quotes.

When you are done making changes, `push` your changes on your branch to `Github`:

```bash
git push origin my-fix-branch
```

Now submit a pull request! We'll review the request and either accept it or ask you to make some changes.

After your pull request is merged, you can delete your branch on Github:

```bash
git push origin --delete
```

Switch back to your `master` branch:

```bash
git checkout master -f
```

And delete your local fix branch branch:

```bash
git branch -D my-fix-branch
```

Finally, update your fork with the master branch of the original repo:

```bash
git pull -ff upstream master
```

If you are new to `git`, Github has several tutorials on what a fork is, how to fork, configure a remote and sync with a remote repository:

- [About Forks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/)
- [How to fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

They have a pretty great guide overall about a fork workflow:

This article includes how to configure a remote for a fork, and how to sync a fork with the original repo:
