### What is Code for Foco

We are programmers, designers, hackers, makers, tinkerers, writers and artists and we want to have an impact on the community around us.

We are dedicated to using technology to solve everyday challenges that the people, non-profits, charities, schools, government and grassroots organizations of Fort Collins face.

Simply put, our goal is to create a community of volunteers who are passionate about using their skills to benefit the Fort Collins community.

Code for Fort Collins is one of many organizations trying to impact the nation. We are supported by Code for America and are being advised by both Code for Denver and Code for Boulder.

### CFFC's Action Plan

CFFC will accomplish it's goals through:

- Creating partnerships with organizations, non-profits, schools and other groups in the Fort Collins community.
- Creating partnerships with the City of Fort Collins, Larimer County and Colorado State Gov.
- Organizing events and teams to educate the community.
- Organizing events and teams to create for the community.
- Committing ourselves to transparency and openness.

Transparency:

- enables anybody to easily get involved in any matter.
- allows anybody to know exactly what CFFC has, is and will be doing.
- holds the organization and all authority accountable.

Openness:

- allows for people to use the things we build in their own community.
- lowers the barrier for anybody to get involved.

### CFFC's Partnership Opportunities

CFFC helps partners and in any way possible:

- Help partners identify problems they are facing.
- Demonstrate to partners that tech can solve these problems.
- Provide websites, tools, software and applications to overcome partners problems.

CFFC promotes partners through events, social media and web presence.

Partners may, but are not required to, provide benefits to CFFC.

- Opportunities
- Event space
- Material donations (finances, devices, swag, etc..)
- Discounted services (hosting, software, etc..)
- Promotion (events, social media, personal connections, web presence, etc..)

### Planned Events

### Current Project Proposals

Improve Homeless Lives

- A project that allows people to give money to the homeless in a way that ensures the money will be spent positively.
- Ensures money can't be spent on alcohol, tobacco or drugs.
- Could be a partnership with Safeway and other markets in the region.

### Discussion: how Can CFFC Help You?

- CFFC can use the open data you provide to not only benefit the community but demonstrate to the public the value of open data.
- CFFC can build applications for the city that benefit the community in general.
- We have an alignment of values; a commitment to openness and transparency.
- We both hold an interest in helping the homeless.

### Discussion: General Questions

- Projects have a long lifespan after they are released, how will we maintain the projects?

  - We have an abundance of members who are programmers and are hungry for experience and passionate about what they do.

- A project would quickly fall apart if anybody could contribute, how do we vet contributions?

  - Each project has a Product Owner, it is their duty to vet contributions.
  - Only contributions that adhere to our code style guide will be accepted.
  - Only contributions that pass all unit tests will be accepted.

## Discussion: Advice and General Discussion

- CFFC should get involved with the school districts.

  - A class in Boston developed an app using open data to provide legal solutions.
  - A class in Vermont developed an app to aid farmers write agricultural leases.

- CFFC & FCGov should keep an open communication line.
- If CFFC needs data that might not be published, get in touch to see if it can be.
- CFFC should keep FCGov up to date with event schedules.
