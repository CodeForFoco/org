# Onboarding

Goal of onboarding is to welcome somebody to the group, invite them to our communication channels and get them that first commit. It should cover the following:

1. Talk about Code for Foco.
1. Round of introductions.
1. You are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct][code].
1. Join the [Code for Foco Slack Channel][slack].
1. Sign up for a [GitHub Account][git].
1. Sign the [Registry][registry].

Sign the registry should involve them forking the repo, cloning it to their machine, making the changes, pushing the changes to github, creating a pull request. (If they seem overwhelmed they could just use the web interface, but I think this is a good opportunity to teach our git/fork workflow).

They don't need to install Jekyll or Ruby or actually get the site to run on their local machine, this can be a stretch goal for those who already have experience with git and github.

After they complete the onboarding tasks encourage them to go join or sit in on a project and asking questions, poke around, break things.
