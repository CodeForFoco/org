Onboarding should cover the following (https://github.com/CodeForFoco/org#joining-code-for-foco) :

1. Join the Foco Slack Channel (https://codeforfocoslack.herokuapp.com)
1. Sign up for a GitHub Account (https://github.com/join)
1. Sign the Registry  (https://github.com/CodeForFoco/codeforfoco.github.io/tree/master/_posts/registry)

Goal of onboarding is to get them in our communication channels and get them that first commit high.

Sign the registry should involve them forking the repo, cloning it to their machine, making the changes, pushing the changes to github, creating a pull request. (If they seem overwhelmed they could just use the web interface, but I think this is a good opportunity to teach our git/fork workflow).

They don't need to install Jekyll or Ruby or actually get the site to run on their local machine, this can be a stretch goal for those who already have experience with git and github.

After they complete the onboarding tasks encourage them to go join or sit in on a project and asking questions, poke around, break things.
